This Python code for Autodesk Maya creates a polygon gear with 20 teeth, with the faces selected for easy scaling.  

Modyify the code to change the gear size and number of teeth.  

You may use even or odd numbers of teeth.  Currently there is a bug that makes the last tooth half-height unless you select 1 subdivision level for the Y axis.

To use this script:

1.  Open Maya
2.  Open the Script Editor
3.  Paste this script into a Python tab
4.  Execute the script


You may also middle-mouse drag the code to the shelf to create a custom button in Maya
